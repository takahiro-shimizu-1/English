I'm going to talk about an event for developing apps.

Next month, I will be holding an event. The goal is to develop AGI.

AGI stands for Artificial General Intelligence. It's a more advanced form of AI. AGI can learn, think, and act on its own in any situation, just like humans.

While AI requires human instructions, AGI can do anything and acts independently.

I held an AI related event last year too. But this time, it's the world's first attempt to create AGI that surpasses AI.

There's a lot to do like planning, preparing, and promoting the event. But each time I complete a task, I get excited thinking  we're one step closer to the event.

I'm really looking forward to seeing what kind of groundbreaking and interesting things will be created.

I'll join as a participant too.  I'll do my best to create something amazing.

That's all.
