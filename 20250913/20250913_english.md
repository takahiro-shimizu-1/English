I'm going to talk about an event for developing apps.

Next month, I will be holding an event to develop AGI that goes even further than AI.

AGI stands for Artificial General Intelligence. It's a more advanced form of AI. It can learn, think, and act on its own in any situation, just like humans.

Whilst AI cannot do anything without human instructions, AGI can do anything and acts autonomously.

I hosted an AI-related event last year as well.

However, this time it's the world's first attempt to create AGI that surpasses AI.

Organising the event, preparing for it, and promoting it is challenging, but when I think about hosting an event where something that doesn't yet exist in this world will be created, I can enjoy doing it.

And I'm extremely excited to see what kind of ground-breaking and interesting things will be created.

I'm also planning to participate as one of the participants myself.

So I'll do my best to create something interesting that could change the world as well.

That's all.
