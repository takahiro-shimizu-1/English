Today, I'm going to talk about an art exhibition.

My friend knows a lot about art.
He highly recommended an art exhibition called "TOKYO PROTOTYPE."
I was curious, so the day before yesterday, I visited it.
It's being held at Toranomon Hills from the day before yesterday until 9 PM today.

The concept of this event is to imagine the future of cities.
Creators, artists, and companies display experimental products and artworks based on their vision.
There are many different exhibits on display.
For example, shadow art that seems to come towards you, and fish swimming through the air.
Some of the exhibits you can touch or experience yourself.
In addition, there are also products still in development and the creative process behind everyday items.

I was particularly interested that the creators themselves explained their works directly.
I could hear about why they made them, what they struggled with, and what they put extra thought into.

However, to be honest, it was too advanced for me.
I couldn't understand about one third of the exhibits.

I told this to the friend who recommended the event.
He said, "You don't have to understand everything.
Even just thinking about it is fine.
You can have your own interpretation."

I had never thought that way before, so I was very surprised.
It was very enjoyable and changed my view on art, so I'm really glad I went.

That's all. Thank you.
