I'm going to talk about an event for developing apps.

I held an event until last month.
In this event, each team had several members and spent several weeks developing one product.
The theme of this event was to create an AI system called AGI, which is a more advanced form of AI.
I was an organizer of this event, and I also joined as a participant.

As an organizer I tried to get participants.
However, it was hard to find people because the theme was so challenging.
So I tried various promotion methods, and held information sessions and Q&A sessions.
As a result, I managed to gather participants.
I didn't expect it would be so difficult to gather people.

As a participant, I really enjoyed developing a product with my team members.
Every night, we discussed ideas until early morning.
And we developed the system at high speed by watching and copying how others used AI.

The other teams' products were also very interesting.
For example, one app had an AI tutor that created personalized questions based on the user's understanding.
Another app had an AI assistant that managed schedules and encouraged users when needed.

There were many difficulties, but I'm glad I was able to hold such a valuable and interesting event.

That's all.
