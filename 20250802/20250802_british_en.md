I'm going to talk about an AI product exhibition.

Last week, I attended an AI product exhibition. I'm also developing products that integrate AI, so I was really curious about what others were creating.

Some companies were exhibiting, but the main exhibitors were individual developers. All the exhibitors were really passionate, and their products were carefully crafted down to the smallest details and had unique features. Many of them explained in detail how things worked and why they built them. And most visitors were also individual developers, so every exhibition space was always bustling. The exhibition was really interesting.

In particular, I was really interested in a self-management app using an avatar and its developer.

The developer told me he's really terrible at self-management, so he created this app. He said text notifications felt too bland, but with an avatar, it felt like a real person was pushing him to do things. This made it easier for him to take action.

I'd never thought of it that way, and the app used advanced and complex technology, so I found it really interesting.

Overall, the exhibition was both interesting and educational. That's all, thank you.
