Today, I'm going to talk about buying a new computer.
Recently, I went to a shop to look at new computer.
The computer I'm using now was purchased five years ago.
I use it from morning until night every day.
Recently, it's been acting up quite a bit.
I thought I'd buy a new one before it breaks down completely.

At first, I tried looking online.
But there were too many options, and the price range was really wide.
So I decided to go to a shop and speak to a shop assistant.
By chance, this shop assistant does AI research as a hobby.
I'm also trying to customise and run AI on my own computer.
So the shop assistant was able to choose the right computer for my specific needs.
What's more, based on his own experience, he explained what hardware upgrades I'll need as my AI research progresses.

He also told me about his own research.
It was unique, and groundbreaking research based on solid evidence.
So I was really interested.

Unfortunately, the new computer will take a while to arrive.
But I'm really looking forward to it.

That's all, thank you.
