Today, I'm going to talk about the first time I met online friends.

The other day, I met three of my online friends in person.
I got to know them through an online developer community.
We had spoken online and organised several online events together, and we became good friends.
However, we had never actually met face to face.

One of them lives in Hiroshima and has young children.
Then she let me know she was coming to Tokyo on a business trip.
It was a rare opportunity, so we decided to meet, even though we only had two hours.

On the day, the four of us gathered in Ginza at half past eight in the morning.
We walked around Ginza for a while.
However, it was far too cold on a February morning, so we went to a cafe.
I remember it was wonderfully warm inside.

We hadn't had the chance to talk even online recently, so we talked about everything, like our work and AI.
We also talked about families and hobbies.
We had never shared those things before.
Everything felt fresh, and we never ran out of things to talk about.

It was a really great time.
That is all. Thank you.
